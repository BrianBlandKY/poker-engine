## Why?

I blame Jason Somerville for this application! I watch twitch streams quite often and a while back I got hooked onto Jason's stream (twitch.tv/jcarverpoker). He brought back poker for me and made me realize that it's more than gambling and the math involved is really interesting. After hearing him talk about the current state of the industry I was motivated to see what it took to build a poker website (play money ONLY) to learn and practice with No-Limit Hold 'em odds. I quickly discovered after I built a engine to deal random cards to x amount of people the real trick was to see who won in a showdown... I found this to be crazy and discovered there are Universities dedicated in researching poker evaluations. There are a couple other hand evaluations online but nothing that satisfied my needs.
