Poker
============

C++ Poker Engine for NodeJS Integration.

Development: Active, On Hold.

Start Date: Fall 2014

## Why?

I blame Jason Somerville for this application! I watch twitch streams quite often and a while back I got hooked onto Jason's stream (twitch.tv/jcarverpoker). He brought back poker for me and made me realize that it's more than gambling and the math involved is really interesting. After hearing him talk about the current state of the industry I was motivated to see what it took to build a poker website (play money ONLY) to learn and practice with No-Limit Hold 'em odds. I quickly discovered once I built the engine to deal random cards to x amount of people the real trick was to see who won in a showdown... I found this to be crazy and discovered there are Universities dedicated in researching poker evaluations. There are a couple other hand evaluations online but nothing that satisfied my needs.


Research Material

This guy built a 7-card Hold Em' evaluator and sold the license. Certified bad ass.

Bitwise approach that really helps you understand ways to optimize process intensive tasks.
